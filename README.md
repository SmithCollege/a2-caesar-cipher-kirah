## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
I really enjoyed diving into encoding/decoding methods. After what I learned from assignment 1, I've grown to love drawing graphs that illustrate each step of the process. Visualizing everything helped me a lot—especially when I felt lost among all the different iterator bounds. Sketching it out really cut down on my mistakes.

What was most challenging about this assignment?
At first, I struggled with understanding how the 'DynamicArray' and 'CaesarCipher' classes interact. The 'get' method in CaesarCipherTest was particularly frustrating because I couldn’t just use the same method from DynamicArray directly. I’m still not clear on why, in CaesarCipher, this method needs to output a transformed result (since there’s already an encoding method) instead of just returning the original value. I did feel lucky that setting up Gradle didn’t take too long and ran smoothly throughout the assignment. Another tough part was getting the iterator to work correctly—the precision required really took up a lot of my time.

General comments on your experience with this assignment:
This was the first time I encountered so many files in a single project. It felt a bit overwhelming at first, but once I broke down the requirements and split the big problems into smaller ones, it became much more manageable.
